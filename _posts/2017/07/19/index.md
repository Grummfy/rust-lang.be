## Welcome - Grummfy

## Rust's type system & database - Pieter Penninckx

When loading data from a database table, it's common practice to only consider
the fields one is interested in and to discard the unneeded fields. 
In his talk, Pieter Penninckx explains how Rust's type system can represent the
resulting, partial data.
In particular, he illustrates how the power of Rust's generics, traits and 
associated types can be used to express partial data in a way that is practical,
type-safe and that can be used outside of the context of databases as well.
The talk is intended to be accessible to people who have little experience in
Rust while also giving some insight to more experienced Rustacians.
